          Cross River State is located in the South-South region of Nigeria, 
          sharing an eastern border with Cameroon. Known for its rich cultural 
          heritage, diverse ethnic groups, and lush natural landscapes, it is 
          home to the famous Obudu Mountain Resort and the annual Calabar Carnival, 
          often called "Africa's biggest street party." The state's capital, 
          Calabar, is one of Nigeria's oldest cities and a major tourist destination.
          Cross River is also recognized for its biodiversity, rainforests, and agricultural activities.
